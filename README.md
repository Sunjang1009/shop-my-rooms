# shop my rooms

## description
As a user and shopper, I want to be able to navigate through different themes that contain suitable images. Once I select a theme, I expect to receive multiple suggestions with images that already have items. With the provided lookbook, I should be able to effortlessly browse through all the items on the image, and each item should have a link for easy access to more information or purchasing.
